# reach-out
My job is normally in person tech support, but due to COVID-19 all support is now remote. Like most people working during this time, I've experienced much heavier than typical workloads. For the sake of time, I've created a program to quickly reach out to reach out to clients in a courteous and personalized manner.

# dependencies
Python 3.X (built with 3.7)

# setup
Assuming you've properly configured Python (and Tkinter if on linux), all that's left is to edit the settings.py file to properly reflect your contact info as well as the directory you'd like for the script to run in.
